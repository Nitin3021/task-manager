# Task Manager (Manage your tasks with ease!)

## Overview
Welcome to one of my personal projects! As the project name makes it clear, the idea behind this project is to allow users to manage their daily tasks. This app has been built using NodeJS. User can create, update and manage tasks. This project is only providing API endpoints, without any frontend.

## Features

- Sign up stage for first time user.
- Login authentication after a successful sign up.
- Multiple logins can be done on different devices using tokens.
- Image can be uploaded in your user profile.
- Welcome email is sent to the users who are newly signing up.
- Email is also sent when the user decides to delete their account.
- Tasks can be managed independently as they are stored in the database.
- Pagination is available to scroll through set of tasks.

## Usage

## Database
This project uses MongoDB along with Mongoose, to store and manage user & task related data. It is essential to setup MongoDB before executing the project.

### Project creation
This project has been created using npm version 7.1.0.

### Env Variables

Create 2 files, "dev.env" & "test.env" in /config folder (in root of the project) and add the following to both of the files.

```
PORT=3000
MAILGUN_API_KEY= (Register in https://www.mailgun.com/ and get the API key for your account)
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/api-task-manager
JWT_SECRET=abcdefgh123456
```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```
npm install
```

### Run
```
# Running MongoDB (This step is essential and needs to be successfully setup before proceeding to next step)
After downloading MongoDB executables from MongoDB website, you can use following command to run Database.
(Downloaded Mongodb directory)\mongod.exe --dbpath="(Your new directory path to store data)"
```

```
# Run in development environment

```

There is a Heroku start script for executing after deployment.
